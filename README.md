## evolution-stage0

the app is an evolution in progress. no is in stage 0.

it's a javascript web app (both server and client).

it uses react, redux, server side rendering, css and sass modules.

it incorporates state changes of the app to browser history so you can navigate through state changes of the app back and forth. it keeps state on server side rendering (reloading).

it addresses data fetching issues. data fetching it is made on the client side through api calls.

it also addresses routing through state navigation. routing becomes a change in state, nothing more.
